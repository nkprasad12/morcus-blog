# Features

## Dictionary

### Bottom Drawer {#bottom-drawer}

On narrow screen (usually mobile) views, the table of contents is now in a bottom drawer. This allows for access to the table of contents
no matter where you are in a long article.

You can still use it (check `Display Settings` under the `Dictionary Options`)! ![Screenshot showing the layout settings](/images/2025-03-R1/dict-options.png)
