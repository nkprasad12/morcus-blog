## No more auto-expansions

Previously, the dictionaries auto-expanded some abbreviations where we had a high confidence of the meaning of an expansion.
However, there have been a fair number of edge cases where the auto-expansions have resulted in misleading or just incorrect
replacements.

As a result, this release removes all auto-expansions. You can still see the possible expanded forms by clicking on
abbreviated text.
