# Features

## Dictionary

### Georges

The German-to-Latin dictionary by Georges (Kleines deutsch-lateinisches Handw√∂rterbuch) is now available! Thanks to Nikita Murzintcev of [latin-dict.github.io](https://latin-dict.github.io/dictionaries/Georges1910.html) for making source data available in easy-to-parse XML. The original version was provided into the public domain by Thomas Vogt.

### Permanent Dictionary Selection

Dictionary selection will now be persisted across sessions (previously, these selections only lasted until the browser tab was closed). As always, you can click the gear icon in the dictionary search bar to enable or disable dictionaries. This may be useful for users who do not wish to see results for e.g. English words or German words.

## Library

The following are newly available on the [library](https://morcus.net/library):

- By Tacitus: `Dialogus de Oratoribus`
- By Cicero: `Pro Quinctio` and `Pro Quinto Roscio`
