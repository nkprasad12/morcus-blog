### Hypotactic Works

Thanks to David Chamberlain of Hypotactic, we will soon start showing the Hypotactic version of texts on the site.
Currently, the vowel lengths marked in that project are available and can be toggled on and off.

Scansion is not yet surfaced in the reader, but will be in the future.

The pilot works are the `Metamorphoses` of `Ovid` and the `Aeneid`.
