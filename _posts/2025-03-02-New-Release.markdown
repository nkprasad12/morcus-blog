# Features

## Dictionary

### Bottom Drawer {#bottom-drawer}

On narrow screen (usually mobile) views, the table of contents is now in a bottom drawer. This allows for access to the table of contents
no matter where you are in a long article.

#### If you prefer the old layout

You can still use it (check `Display Settings` under the `Dictionary Options`)! ![Screenshot showing the layout settings](/images/2025-03-R1/dict-options.png)

### Numeral Dictionary

The dictionary will now provide basic results for numbers that are explicitly listed in our inflection tables. More advanced features,
like generating results for the result of the numbers, will come in a future release.
