# Features

## Dictionary

### Pozo (Early Preview)

A Spanish to Greek / Latin dictionary is now available. Due to a significant number of typos in the digitization, this is disabled by default (as we fix the issues) but can be turned in on the settings.
 
Thanks to Nikita Murzintcev of [latin-dict.github.io](https://latin-dict.github.io/dictionaries/LopezPozo1997.html) for making source data available.

## Reader

A bug with incorrect handling of HTML entites in scraped URL texts is now fixed, and should now display correctly.
